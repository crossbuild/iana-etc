THE IANA /etc FILES PACKAGE


ABOUT

    The iana-etc package installs services(5) and protocols(5) using data from
    the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority <http://www.iana.org/>.  In future,
    other such files may be added.

    Included are snapshots of the data from the IANA, scripts to transform that
    data into the needed formats, and scripts to fetch the latest data.

    Bug reports and patches are welcome.

    Thanks go to the Linux From Scratch users whose scripts and bug reports
    against the, now obsolete, LFS HINT served as inspiration and assistance.

PORT ALIASES

    Please report any additional port aliases that you need. The port-aliases
    file contains the current list.  To minimize cruft, it includes only
    aliases for which there has been reported need. 

    If you need an alias that isn't included, you may see the error:

	getaddrinfo: Servname not supported for ai_socktype

    Some useful things for finding out what alias is needed:
     o strace <http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/>
     o grep -r 'getaddrinfo' in the appropriate source tree

    The various RFCs and such usually list the number for an alias but it may
    be faster to just check the FreeBSD services file at
    <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/etc/services>.

    Bug reports and patches are welcome at the maintainer address listed above.

DEPENDENCIES

    GNU Awk
	Numerous GNU Awk extensions are used.  Awk was chosen over Perl for
	its smaller size and more flexible installation process which are
	important in a bootstrap environment.

	For mawk compatibility, services.gawk and protocols.gawk might be
	ported which would allow installation with mawk only.  If you do this,
	please send patches.

	Using GNU Bash for network fetching and sh/sed for filtering might
	achieve greater portability. If you're interested, feel free to contact
	the maintainer.

    Make
	Testing is only done with GNU Make but incompatibilities with other
	make implementations are probably bugs. Please send patches.

INSTALLATION

    Installation is flexible and friendly to unattended installation even
    though, due to its simplicity, it does not use GNU Autoconf.

    For basic installation run:

	make
	su
	make install

    This creates /etc/services and /etc/protocols without using internet
    access.

    To install in a different location, use something like:

	make PREFIX=/mnt/tmp install

    This would create /mnt/tmp/etc/services and /mnt/tmp/etc/protocols.

    For unusual installations, "make PREFIX=/foo ETC_DIR=bar install" will
    create /foo/bar/services and /foo/bar/protocols.

GETTING FRESH DATA

    If you fetch the latest data from the IANA, make sure to check the files
    produced from it for breakage.  There is little to be gained from the
    latest data unless you're using experimental applications, but if you
    really want it, "make get" fetches it.

DOCUMENTATION

    Man pages are provided by the man-pages package. See
